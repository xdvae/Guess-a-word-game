# Making guess word game things to do :

# Import the game data dict (contains arrays as key value pairs of name and three hints). 

# Make a greet() function that asks user if they wanna play or not.

# Make a start() function that will start the game details about how the game will go below:

# Start function will pick a random word from a dict of words, get it's length and display an empty underscore equal to the size of the word eg:- (word: elephant , empty line: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _).

# User will have 10 tries after 2,3 wrong guesses it will show another hint until it tries reach 0, if user guess is right start another function that will show the win or loose screen.

# Use booleans to impliment which hint to show eg:- if (hint_1 == True): show hint else keep it hidden make use of this for 3 hints.
# Note: After every 2-3 answers that are guessed wrong, set one boolean to true otherwise the hint will not show. 

# Make a gameover() function that will take a boolean as parameter if user wins set the parameter to True and send it to the gameover() function to display the winnig screen, else display the loose screen if the boolean is wromg.

#This text below has the text colors as variables without them the code will not work-
